# Facility-Access-System-using-Face-Recognition
Our advanced facial recognition access control system utilizes individuals' unique facial features to grant access, providing enhanced security and customized access control within the premises. The system's user-friendly interface allows administrators to assign different access levels for specific groups, and it includes auto train features and dashboards for easy management. Additionally, hand gestures can trigger the system, eliminating unnecessary detections. With our system, the need for physical keys or access cards is eliminated, making access quick and easy while reducing the risk of unauthorized entry.
